# Decoupling Growth from CO2 Emissions
Investigate the relationship between global CO2 emissions and economic growth (measured by GDP per capita) across countries and regions, exploring whether economic growth can occur without proportional increases in emissions (decoupling).

## Research Questions
1. Correlation Analysis: Is there a significant correlation between GDP per capita and CO2 emissions per capita across countries?
2. Regional Differences: Do CO2 emissions per capita differ significantly across regions (e.g., Asia vs. Europe)?
3. Temporal Trends: How have CO2 emissions and GDP per capita trends evolved over time (e.g., 2010â€“2022), and is there evidence of decoupling in specific countries?
